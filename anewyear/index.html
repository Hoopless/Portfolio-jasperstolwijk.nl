        <h2>This was quite the year</h2>
        <p>
          This year was amazing, had new experiences and faced tons of difficulties. FInished a study and started a new study which I had been aiming towards for the last 19 years. Saw people grow and saw family members die or have a huge impact on me with their lives which I am still thankful for.
          <br><br>
          A year with amazing memes, amazing series and amazing creators around the world. A year with a lot of negativity or tons of positivity. But after all, it was amazing and hopefully 2019 will be an even better year.
        </p>
        <h2>Canada</h2>
        <p>
          I went road tripping in Canada for 3 weeks. I made new memories, met someone from Hypixel, saw the beautiful nature and the annoying wildfires.

        <h2>Hypixel</h2>
        <p>
          Hypixel had a huge impact on me this year, I got promoted to Helper on March the 3rd. Since then I have learned a lot of new things in the team. I have met tons of new people in the staff team and outside the team and decided what to focus on in the team and to be active in the chat. It is amazing what I have accomplished this year on Hypixel and I never thought I would get this amazing opportunity from the managers and from the team itself.
          <br><br>
          With the reveal of Hypixels new standalone game â€˜Hytaleâ€™, Iâ€™m still in shock of what the administrators have been capable of and the amount of work they have put in over the years. I canâ€™t wait whatâ€™s more to come in 2019. I hope Hytale will be an amazing game and a huge success

          Down below you will see some tweets that were special in my eyes or saved a new memory. You have probably already seen them on my feed.

        <h2>School</h2>
        <p>
          In 2016 I started a new study called â€˜employee management ICTâ€™. During that study, I taught myself to make websites and understand HTML, CSS and Javascript. Hopefully, in 2019 I will develop myself even more and even have even more knowledge about writing code and making websites. Last but not least, I want to finish this year of study and Iâ€™m hoping next year will be the same.
        </p>
        <h2>Family</h2>
        <p>
          My family has had a huge impact on my life this year. They have helped me get my drivers licence, with my study and they have supported me this whole year. A family member that has been really close to me for the past 10 years past away this year due to cancer. In December we had a huge family dinner. My family is amazing and Iâ€™m thankful for everything that we have done for each other.
