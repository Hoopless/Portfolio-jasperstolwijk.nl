        <p>Well hello there, nice to see you watching here. I am Jasper Stolwijk, From The Netherlands. Studying in Application development, focusing on front-end (What you are seeing right now) and design. I am a friendly creature on this planet and always in my natural habitat. I like to do ‘whatever floats my boat’ while planning in what I am going to do that day or week. Always busy with doing something and often not ‘bored’ as there is always something you can learn in this planet. This includes on youtube and other free learning methods.

        I got my first laptop at the age of 6 which was a high-end laptop for that time being with Windows XP on it. Started to play a game called ‘habbo’ which was popular in my country and most children played it. After some years I have met someone online who also played Minecraft and since then I was playing Minecraft non-stop</p>

          <p ">The Defender personality type is quite unique, as many of their qualities defy the definition of their individual traits. Though sensitive, Defenders have excellent analytical abilities; though reserved, they have well-developed people skills and robust social relationships; and though they are generally a conservative type, Defenders are often receptive to change and new ideas. As with so many things, people with the Defender personality type are more than the sum of their parts, and it is the way they use these strengths that defines who they are.</p>
